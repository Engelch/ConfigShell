# DefaultGoMode

This test checks `version.sh`  using without configuration files. So, it searches for go-files. Only one go file exists here. This is one of the simplest tests
being done. The added difficulty here is that the go-filename contains spaces. We would normally never put spaces into filenames, but we want to know
if our tool can cope with it.
