NAME
    $_app
SYNOPSIS
    $_app [-D] container [ <<command to be run inside of the container>> ]
    $_app -V
    $_app -h
VERSION
    $_appVersion
DESCRIPTION
    About:
    This commands runs a container, and it does not keep a container artifact
    afterwards. It shall enable to run commands from containers and hereby
    solve problems such as installing multiple psql or mysql client versions
    in parallel on a host.

    Mounting:
    1. The container mounts the root directory of the host os in the container
       under /y
    2. The working directory is kept to be the one before the container start

    Container Command:
    The command uses podman is installed. Otherwise, if docker is found, it is
    used. Else, an error is created.

    Known Limitations:
    - The command cannot be used without adjustments for absolutte paths as
      the / of the host-OS becomes to /y inside the container.
OPTIONS
    -D      ::= enable debug output
    -V      ::= output the version number and exit with 127
    -h      ::= show usage message and exit with exit with 0
EXIT Codes
    <<container exit value>>  ::= exit of normal execution
    0                         ::= exit of help
