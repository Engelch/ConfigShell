-s  ::= show if files are the same
-q  ::= just output a brief line if 2 files differ
--color=[<<when>>]  ::= The possible values of when are “never”, “always”
            and “auto”.  auto will use color if the output is a tty and
            the COLORTERM environment variable is set to a non-empty string.

-r  ::= recursive
-x <<pattern>> ::=  exclude files. Patterns are matched using shell-style globbing via fnmatch(3).

-i  ::= ignore case
-w  ::= ignore all blanks. E.g., “if ( a == b )” will compare equal to “if(a==b)”.
-b  ::= ignore trailing blanks
